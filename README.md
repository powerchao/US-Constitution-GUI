# US-Constitution-GUI

The file "constitution.txt" is a copy paste of the United States Constitution from https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/full-text

Running main.py will create and use a regex object to search and sort out all 27 amendments in the United States Constitution and store them into a pandas DataFrame. 

This DataFrame is used in created a tkinter GUI where the user can select each amendment from a dropdown menu to see the content of that amendment in the text label beneath the dropdown.
